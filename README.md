# Sourcerer for malware detection

The code for Sourcerer comes from [this GitHub repo](https://github.com/Mondego/SourcererCC).

This repo provides code that lightly modifies Sourcerer in two ways:

1. It includes a tokenizer for JavaScript files
2. Instead of detecting clones, it's used to detect malware signatures

The use case is to find malicious packages in open-source package registries like npm.

For details of Sourcerer, see the [ICSE 2016 paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.06448).
For malware samples, have a look at the [Backstabber's Knife dataset](https://dasfreak.github.io/Backstabbers-Knife-Collection/).
